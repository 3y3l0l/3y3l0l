We're strangers to love

You don't know the rules and so don't I

A full commit on github is what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other git

I just wanna tell you how I'm coding

Gotta make you crying stand

Never gonna git you hub

Never gonna watch your star

Never gonna run to god and fork repo

Never gonna make you die

Never gonna say staring

elon musk is coming for you

and amogus
